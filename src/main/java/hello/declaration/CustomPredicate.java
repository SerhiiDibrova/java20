```java
package hello.declaration;

public interface CustomPredicate<T> {
    boolean test(T t);
}
```

Note: Since the original code is already quite simple and doesn't contain any deprecated features, there's not much to update. The provided Java 8 code is compatible with Java 20 standards, so no changes are necessary in this case.
