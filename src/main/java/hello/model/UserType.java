public enum UserType {
    USER,
    ADMIN,
    ALL
}
```

Note: Since the original code is already quite simple and doesn't contain any deprecated features or logic that needs to be updated, the migrated code remains the same. The provided Java 8 code is compatible with Java 20 standards, so no changes are necessary in this case.
