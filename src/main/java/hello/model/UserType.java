```java
package hello.model;

public enum UserType {
    USER,
    ADMIN,
    ALL
}
```

Note: Since the original code is already quite simple and doesn't contain any deprecated features or syntax, there's not much to upgrade in this specific case. The provided Java 8 code is still valid and compatible with Java 20.
